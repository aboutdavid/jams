# NPM/NPX Portfolio - Showcase your skills, while showcasing your creativty

### Details:

_Outcome:_ You'll create a portfolio that renders in the terminal, that can be viewed by running `npx my-portfolio` (a similar name, don't run that command, please)

_Requirements:_ Access to [npm](https://npmjs.com) and [node.js](https://nodejs.com)

_Software used:_ npm and Node.JS

_Customization opportunity:_ You'll be able to make your own portfolio that runs in the terminal, being able to customize it using colours and display images in the terminal! You'll be able to showcase your skills, learn basic operations

_Platform limitations:_ This can only run in the terminal, but should support all operating systems since it uses Node.JS! Repl can be used to create this project

_Time estimation:_ 1 hour

### Breakdown
- Set up: Go to npm and create an account. Then, download and install Node.JS.
- Part 1: Creating the outline of the resume and getting a basic description of yourself
  - Explain how CLI apps measure the terminal screen
  - Writting basic things to the screen, saying hi
- Part 2: Using chalk, chalk animations, and terminal image to make it look pretty
  - We can add some colour and some animations, i.e. a loading bar next to "I've learned 65% of Python!"
  - We can add a picture of ourselves or something we like to it!
- Part 3: Adding some info and creating some actions
  - We can use a service like wttr.in to add the weather near me
  - We can use a prompt library and the `open` package to prompt to email someone, or to open your website

**Make sure your proposal (similar to the one above) answer these questions about your Jam idea:**
- How will you ensure that every outcome of the workshop varies (i.e. how will you give jammers a sense of ownership over their project)? It's like making your own portfolio
- Why should Hack Clubbers care about this project? It teaches you how to make CLI applications in Node.JS, and guides them how to publish to npm, and gives them a feel around the terminal
- General outline of a club meet doing the Jam
- What Club Members will walk away with (both in terms of knowledge and in terms of product)? 
  - How to publish to NPM
  - A portfolio to show colleges and others who want to know more about the person
  - How do use Node in the terminal
- What makes this workshop fun or interesting for Club Members? They'll be able to create a unique terminal portfolio to share to their friends, parents, teachers, and eventually employers. Learning how to make things just "work" in the terminal is always a relieving feeling
- What platforms will be supported (i.e. MacOS, Windows, Chromebook, Mobile, Browser, etc)? Any platform that supports repl, although I wouldn't reccomend a phone to code, for instance
- How will you allow Club Leaders to add their own project to the Jam presentation (giving them a sense of ownership over the meeting)? Since this is a very flexable workshop, club leaders can take the basic concept from this workshop and just run with it, providing their own twist to the workshop to keep their members engaged.
